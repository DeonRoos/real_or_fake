# Real or fake?

This repo contains two datasets. One is real and one is fake. See if you can figure out which is which.

Note that the fake dataset took roughly 30 minutes to an hour to create and refine at 10:30 pm on a Thursday night after a day full of meetings.

Note that the real dataset is relatively well known and freely available, and has therefore been manipulated to obscure it's identity but these changes have largely been superficial or else have been "recoding" values that would reveal it's identity.

There are no tricks. I have not created two fake datasets nor have I uploaded two real datasets. One is real. One is fake.

There are 66 observations in each dataset, each with the same variables.
